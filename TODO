This is a collection of things that could/should be worked on:

== Interaction with other libs:
* make compatible with newer versions of delayed_job...but maintain
compatibility with the send_later() version.

== Robustness:
* in wrangler.rb : render_error_template(), if we fail to find a template for the
exception/status code, we just log that fact right now. this is probably worth
a notification in itself (that a template is missing or config is not set up
properly)...so send an email if an appropriate template cannot be found.
* come up with an automated testing strategy

== Cleanup:
* (Potentially security?) copy what exception_notification does and sanitize
the backtrace before stuffing it into email...from what i could tell from a
quick look, it seemed like it was just cleaning up the stack trace, substituting
[RAILS ROOT] for the path to the rails app (which should make it shorter, but
maybe also to hide the location of the app?)
* resolve the dependency on action mailer so it doesn't install lots of extra
gems every time. also use more up-to-date method of specifying dependencies as
add_dependency appears to be deprecated in rubygems 1.3.6 or 1.3.7 (but remain
backwards compatible with 1.3.5)

== Configuration/flexibility:
* allow for a hash to map status_codes to arbitrary templates explicitly instead
of relying on finding files named after the status code. currently have
implemented the ability to map exceptions to arbitrary templates, so the
pattern/approach has been established.
* allowing for separate exception handler (and notifier?) configuration for
different controllers/classes. probably involves converting the ExceptionHandler
class to being instantiated and have each class that includes the Wrangler
module hold onto that instance (maybe have to move the notifier config back to
the ExceptionHandler class where it used to be... ;)  )
* allow configuring which sections of the email are included (e.g. can leave
out the stacktrace or the request sections...)
* allow custom email views to override the Wrangler email view (e.g. allowing
html, additional data, formatting differences...)
* add xml responses to the :error_class_xxx_templates pattern to allow
configuring xml error response templates
