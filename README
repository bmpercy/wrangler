= Juggler

== NOTE/DISCLAIMER
This gem is almost completely inspired by/ripped off the exception_notification
plugin/gem, but had to hack too much to get things to work with delayed_job
that I just decided to start from scratch. You'll see that much has been
borrowed however, so I owe a huge debt to the originals (exception_notification
[http://github.com/rails/exception_notification] and
super_exception_notification [http://github.com/pboling/exception_notification])
to help me recreate the Rails hacking.

If you don't really care about using delayed_job for your emailing, consider
going back to the originals, as they're likely better maintained.... ;)

== Overview:
A gem for handling exceptions in a Rails application/environment. 

Some highlights:
* Allows for rendering error pages and sending email notifications in case of
errors.
* Allows for lots of configuring of which pages to show, whether to email or not.
* Allows for asynchronous emailing through delayed_job if available, but works
fine even if delayed_job not installed (email will be synchronous however)
* Will honor filter_parameters set in the controller including the Juggler
module (except if the parameters are in the URL for GETs) when logging and
emailing application state at the time of the exception

== Quickstart

== Configuration

== Search algorithm for error templates (given an exception and a status_code):
# if there is an explicit mapping from the exception to an error page in
:error_class_xxx_templates, use that
# if there is a mapping in :error_class_templates for which the exception
returns true to an is_a? call, use that
# if there is a file/template corresponding to the exception name
(underscorified) in one of the following locations, use that:
** config[:error_template_dir]/
** RAILS_ROOT/public/
** JUGGLER_ROOT/rails/app/views/juggler/
# if there is a file/template corresponding to the status code
(e.g. named ###.html.erb where ### is the status code) in one of the following
locations, use that:
** config[:error_template_dir]/
** RAILS_ROOT/public/
** JUGGLER_ROOT/rails/app/views/juggler/
# if there is a file/template corresponding to a parent class name of the
exception (underscorified) one of the following locations, use that:
** config[:error_template_dir]/
** RAILS_ROOT/public/
** JUGGLER_ROOT/rails/app/views/juggler/

== TODO:
* quickstart (bare minimum config to get started -- initializer)
* how to configure handler (initializer)
* how to configure notifier (initializer
* using within a controller
* using within a random class (with an instance)
* using totally 'statically'
* using notify_on_error(&block)
* all of the config values and their defaults
* maintaining the gem:
** using jeweler (so how to build the gem)
** anything else?
