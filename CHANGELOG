HEAD
----
* fixing a bug that arises when code that either isn't an ActionController::Base that includes Wrangler or doesn't include Wrangler module at all passes in a request object to handle_error or handle_exception...because the request_data_from_request method was only available to controllers that included Wrangler. moved the relevant methods out into plain old Wrangler module.

0.1.17
----
* fixing bug in notification template that didn't properly display the exception class name.

0.1.16
----
* adding feature to allow blocking notification-sending when http params match certain patterns (e.g. for ignoring browsers you don't like). note that logs can still be logged to error log, just no notifications.

0.1.15
----
* some comments and notification grammar changes
* allowing notify_on_error to accept an optional message that gets logged on error
* fixing +handle_exception+ so that it logs request contents even if exception is nil

0.1.14
----
* adding method to allow sending notifications on arbitrary error condition detection with or without an actual exception

0.1.13
------
* bug fix to prevent to_str calls on exceptions to be called when they shouldn't (must've been an order of operations error or something :( )

0.1.12
------
* added an exception class for http status 403 - forbidden.

0.1.11
------
* no longer throw exceptions within handle_exception if the exception raised does not respond_to?(:to_str) (e.g. instances of Class).

0.1.7-10
--------
* various attempts to prevent automatic installation of the latest versions of actionpack and activesupport whenever the wrangler gem is installed. giving up at this point, but 0.1.10 will fix a terrible bug introduced in the process of these attempts.

0.1.5
-----
* changed wrangler to log errors before sending notifications in case notification sending somehow results in new exception
* tried a little harder to ensure that exception messages (instead of just object id) is included in logs and exception notifications

0.1.4
-----
* (attempted) bug fix to get the prior version's feature to work properly (to actually override the parent class's settings)

0.1.3
-----
* added a means for setting smtp settings without changing the parent class' settings by overriding the smtp_settings getter method

2009-11-13
